# Batch / Headless Mode

## Headless / Batch Mode

Headless worker command per CLI:

| CLI | Command |
|-----|---------|
| Claude Code | `claude -p "prompt"` |
| **OpenCode** | `opencode run "prompt"` |
| Copilot CLI | `copilot -p "prompt"` |
| Codex | `codex exec "prompt"` |
| Qwen | `qwen -p "prompt"` |
| Antigravity CLI | `agy -p "prompt"` |
| Grok Build CLI | `grok -p "prompt"` |

**Parallel fan-outs — reserve report numbers first.** Before spawning N parallel evaluators, reserve the range: `node reserve-report-num.mjs --count N` (prints e.g. `042-049`); hand each worker its own number. The allocator treats report files, sentinels, tracker row IDs, and tracker report links as occupied; each slot claim is individually atomic (on collision, claimed slots are released and the reservation restarts past it — permanent, harmless gaps). Release with `node reserve-report-num.mjs --release 042-049` when done; stale sentinels are GC'd after 4h, so reserve right before spawning. Never let parallel workers compute `max+1` themselves — that is the #749 race.

### TSV Format for Tracker Additions

One TSV file per evaluation at `batch/tracker-additions/{num}-{company-slug}.tsv`. Single line, 9 tab-separated columns:

```
{num}\t{date}\t{company}\t{role}\t{status}\t{score}/5\t{pdf_emoji}\t[{num}](reports/{num}-{slug}-{date}.md)\t{note}
```

**Column order (IMPORTANT -- status BEFORE score):** 1 `num` (integer) · 2 `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) · 3 `company` · 4 `role` · 5 `status` (canonical) · 6 `score` (`X.X/5`) · 7 `pdf` (`✅`/`❌`) · 8 `report` (markdown link, always **root-relative**: `[num](reports/...)`) · 9 `notes` (one line).

**Note:** In applications.md, score comes BEFORE status; `merge-tracker.mjs` handles the swap automatically.

**Backfilled entries with no evaluation (#1799):** a row added retroactively without an evaluation must carry one of the recognized score sentinels — `N/A`, `—` (em dash), or `-` (hyphen) — never blank, never another placeholder. The column-swap guard (`looksLikeScoreCell` in `tracker-parse.mjs`, #1427) identifies the score column by content pattern (`X.X/5` or one of these sentinels); an unrecognized placeholder makes the row ambiguous and it is skipped with a warning.

**Optional Via field (#1596):** applications through an agency/recruiter append a **tagged** extra field `via={Agency}` (e.g. `via=Hays`) after notes — never positional; the tag is mandatory. A single untagged extra keeps its legacy meaning (location). Unknown end employer → `?` as company (locale-invariant marker, never "Confidential") + a descriptor in notes. `merge-tracker.mjs` rejects ambiguous extras loudly; `--migrate-via` adds the column to an existing tracker.

**Report link normalization:** the TSV always carries a root-relative `[num](reports/...)` link; `merge-tracker.mjs` rewrites it relative to the tracker's own directory (`../reports/...` at `data/applications.md`, `reports/...` at root) so links stay clickable. Idempotent; fix an existing tracker with `node merge-tracker.mjs --migrate` (#760).

**Req/posting ID in notes disambiguates same-title postings (#1524, #2009):** when a company posts two genuinely different requisitions whose titles fuzzy-match (e.g. a leveled variant and its bare title, or two sibling team roles), put the req/job/posting ID in the **notes** column on both rows. `merge-tracker.mjs` reads it (`REQ_NUMBER_RE`) and treats rows carrying *different* recognizable IDs as distinct openings, overriding fuzzy title matching. Recognized forms are a `job id` / `posting id` / `requisition` / `req` / `jr` / `job` / `posting` / `ref` / `r_` label followed by an alphanumeric ID containing at least one digit — e.g. `req JR-10423`, `job id 88214`, `ref R_2291`. Prefer this whenever the JD exposes an ID; it is the only signal that survives near-identical titles.
